                <p>
                    We are undergrad students at Bahria University and we are creating this LitterCam AI project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering Highways Pakistanâ€™s number one imperative is to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured and to achieve year on year efficiency savings of 10%, LitterCam can play a valuable role by reducing the exposure of litter clearance teams to risk and the cost of litter clearance.
